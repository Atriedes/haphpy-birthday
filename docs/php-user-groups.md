# PHP User Groups

> Disclaimer: Apparently, the way User Group should be written (appending __s__ to user or not) is not normalized and depends on each group itself. Therefore, all the possible spellings can appear in the following document and in the rest of the project. :bowtie:

__The participation of the PHP User Groups to this project is essential__. As a mirror and bridge between PHP users and the language ecosystem, they play a key role in gathering people. They consequently deserve to be thanked as well.
