HaPHPy Birthday is about creating a community movie celebrating 20 years of the PHP language and its users involvement.

It aims at gathering a maximun of videos or pictures from the community in order to express the gratefulness of worldwide users to the PHP community in a short movie.

From the 1<sup>st</sup> of September to the 30<sup>th</sup> of October, anyone with a GitHub account (for now) will be able to upload a very short video or picture showing how much s•he loves PHP or its community. Uploaded media can be selfies, placards, variation of the PHP acronym (People Helping People), group photos, self expression, fun pics… anything imaginable (and positive).

Eventually, the provided videos and pictures will be gathered in a short mosaic movie released under a Creative Commons Licence.
