            We use it everyday for professional and personal projects. A huge part of world's website lean on this
            language. We decided to take advantage of this 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary to pay tribute to the PHP
            language and its community. We want to show to the invested people how grateful we are.

            In order to gather the international community in a collaborative and shared event, we thought of a special
            video. A short movie collecting photographs and videos in which PHP users can praise the language at their
            will.
