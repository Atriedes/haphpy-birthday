        title: Celebrating 20 years of PHP
        paragraph: >
            We use it everyday for professional and personal projects. A huge part of world's website lean on this
            language. We decided to take advantage of this 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary to pay tribute to the PHP
            language and its community. We want to show to the invested people how grateful we are.

    video:
        title: The anniversary video
        paragraph: >
            In order to gather the international community in a collaborative and shared event, we thought of a special
            video. A short movie collecting photographs and videos in which PHP users can praise the language at their
            will.

    contribute:
        title: How to contribute!
        paragraph: >
            Share amongst other contributors a 3 seconds video or a simple picture. Communicate your thoughts, show your
            passion for the language or simply show off your commitment using a sign, a disguise or whatever you feel will
            express your emotions. Every positive film, photographs or drawing will be included in the final cut.
            Uploaded files will be edited altogether as a huge patchwork in a celebrating video.
